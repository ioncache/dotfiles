.SH NAME
weatherrc \- configuration file format for the
.BR weather (1)
utility
.SH DESCRIPTION
The weatherrc file format is intended to specify a set of macros
by which to group a METAR station ID for current conditions data with a
city/state combination for a forecast, but many of the other
command\-line options and flags for the weather utility can be specified
as well. The file is organized as an INI-format config, with the alias
name in [] brackets and the associated parameter/value pairs on following
lines. Parameters and their values as separated by = or : characters.
Multi-word values do not need quoting.

.SH URL FORMAT
The placeholders %city% and %st% in the furl URL and %id% in the murl URL
will be replaced with the city, st and id definitions respectively. If the
placeholder has all letters lowercased, the replacement will be forced to
all lowercase. If the placeholder has all letters uppercased, the
replacement will be forced to all uppercase. If the placeholder has its
first letter uppercased and the remainder lowercased, then all words in the
replacement will start with an uppercase letter and the rest will be
lowercase. If the placeholder has its last letter uppercased and the
remainder lowercased, then case will be preserved in the replacement. Also,
after replacement, any spaces in the resulting URL will be converted to
underscore characters prior to use.
