 Weather License
=================

The weather project employs the ISC license, a permissive free software license
written by the Internet Systems Consortium and functionally equivalent to the
2-clause BSD license. Initially used for the ISC's own software releases, it
has since become the preferred license of many projects (OpenBSD, for example).
