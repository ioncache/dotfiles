	* (all): Updated copyright notices for 2010.

	* FAQ, INSTALL, LICENSE, README: Reformatted as ReStructuredText.

	* FAQ: Updated to mention alternative sources for NOAA's stations
	list, in case the recommended one is unavailable (thanks Celejar!).

	* NEWS: Renamed to ChangeLog and refactored into GNU format.
	
	* weather: Added some comment padding between the shebang line and
	the copyright, so that distributions wishing to carry patches which
	modify the interpreter path don't have to refresh them every year
	when the copyright line changes in their context.

	* weather, weather.1, weatherrc.5, weather.py: Added experimental
	alert, atypes, aurl and zones options to support retrieval,
	filtering and formatting of unexpired NWS severe weather advisories.

	* weather.1, weatherrc.5: Minor cosmetic fixes to option
	descriptions.

	* weather.1, weatherrc.5, weather.py: Added imperial and metric
	options to filter/convert display units (thanks to Andrew Carter for
	this suggestion!).

	* weather.py: Fixed a METAR parsing error which would trigger an
	IndexError exception if the NWS didn't have a station description on
	file (thanks to Celejar for reporting the bug!). Fixed METAR title
	line parsing to look for human-readable city and state in the first
	line--previous code stopped showing the city name after NWS made
	slight format mods. Upped the version to 1.5.

	* weatherrc: Additional PIE (Saint Petersburg, FL), PNC (Ponca City,
	OK), and PNS (Pensacola, FL) aliases.

	* (all): Updated the copyright years for 2008 on some of the files
	in the current release and added a copyright statement to any files
	previously lacking one.

	* LICENSE: Replaced the previous BSD-like license with the one used
	by the OpenBSD project (modeled after the Internet Software
	Consortium's, a two-clause BSD license removing language made
	unnecessary by the Berne convention); this new license is
	functionally identical to the old one, just more terse and openly
	recognized.

	* weather: Clarified function parameters in calls from the wrapper
	script to ease future ABI changes in the underlying module.

	* weather, weather.py: Some extra comments were added to the source,
	indentation style was updated from tab characters to three-space,
	and lines longer than 79 columns were refactored or otherwise split.

	* weather.1, weather.5, weather.py: Added an flines option to allow
	the maximum number of forecast output lines to be shortened. Added
	furl and murl options to allow overriding of the default current
	conditions and forecast data retrieval URLs. Added a headers option
	to allow overriding the default list of header names for current
	conditions data filtering. Added a quiet option to suppress the
	preamble lines and indentation for both current conditions and
	forecast output.

	* weather.py: Replaced the hardcoded fallback default METAR station
	ID and forecast city/state abbreviation with error messages to
	minimize confusion when necessary values are omitted. Adjusted a
	couple of hard-coded error message strings to be consistent with the
	output format of the option_parser module. Switched from urllib to
	urllib2 for retrieving data, providing a simpler means to detect and
	report retrieval errors. Upped the version to 1.4.

2006-07-25 23:00:47 UTC  Jeremy Stanley  <fungi@yuggoth.org>

	* FAQ: Update to clarify that specifying an id won't automatically
	provide a city and st to get the accompanying forecast.

	* weather: Provided a consistent means for relocating weather.py to
	a private location; thanks to Mark Tran for pointing out a conflict
	with pyweather in ArchLinux (and presumably other distros as well).

	* weather.py: Upped the version to 1.3.

2006-06-30 17:42:14 UTC  Jeremy Stanley  <fungi@yuggoth.org>

	* FAQ, README: Updated for inclsuion of weather-util in Debian.

	* weather.py: Upped the version to 1.2.

	* weatherrc: Added more default aliases PAO and SJC (requested by
	Russ Allbery).

2006-04-18 04:33:21 UTC  Jeremy Stanley  <fungi@yuggoth.org>

	* weather: Switched to "#!/usr/bin/env python" instead for
	portability.

	* weather.1, weather.5, weather.py: Implemented the --omit-forecast
	option to cancel --forecast.

	* weather.py: Calling with undefined aliases now throws an error and
	exits. Aliases, options and default overrides operate more
	logically. Upped the version to 1.1.

	* weatherrc: Added 214 standard aliases.

2006-03-26 17:08:52 UTC  Jeremy Stanley  <fungi@yuggoth.org>

	* Initial release 1.0.
