Prerequisites
-------------
You need the Python interpreter installed somewhere in your path (most modern
UNIX derivatives come with one already). If you need to get Python, it can be
obtained from http://www.python.org/ (but chances are your operating system at
least provides some sort of native package for it, which you should probably
install in whatever means is recommended by your OS vendor/distributor).

Running in Place
----------------
An easy way to try it out is to unpack the tarball and change to the resulting
directory::

   tar xzf weather-*.tar.gz
   cd weather-*
   ./weather --version
   ./weather --help
   man ./weather.1
   man ./weatherrc.5
   ./weather --forecast --no-conditions --city=charlotte --st=nc
   ./weather ord sea

...and so on. The weather utility, included Python module and documentation are
all fully functional when kept together in one directory, if somewhat
inconvenient.

Installing the Utility
----------------------
The file named weather should be made executable and put somewhere in your path
(/usr/local/bin/ or ~/bin/ for example). Similarly, weather.py needs to be
somewhere in Python's include path. You can see your Python interpreter's
default include path by running::

   python -c "import sys ; print sys.path"

Configuration
-------------
The weatherrc file should go in /etc/ or you can save it in your home directory
as a dotfile (~/.weatherrc) to support user-specific alias configuration and
overrides of the global /etc/weatherrc file.

Manuals
-------
Optionally, the weather.1 and weatherrc.5 files can be placed in sane locations
for TROFF/NROFF manual files on your system (for example, /usr/local/share/man/
or ~/man/).
