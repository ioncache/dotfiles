.SH NAME
weather \- command\-line tool to obtain weather conditions and forecasts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B weather [ options ] [ alias [ alias [...] ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility is intended to provide quick access to current weather
conditions and forecasts. Presently, it is capable of providing data for
localities throughout the United States of America by retrieving and
processing METAR data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and forecasts from the National Weather Service. Behavior
can be determined by command\-line options and specification of zero or
more aliases. Aliases are defined in weatherrc files, as a convenient
means of grouping option combinations together using a short name.
Specifying multiple aliases on the command line causes the utility to
output data for each, as if it had been invoked multiple times. If no
alias is specified, then an alias of "default" is used (assuming it has
been defined) or the built\-in default values are chosen (if it has not).
