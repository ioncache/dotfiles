What?
-----
This command-line utility is intended to provide quick access to current
weather conditions and forecasts. Presently, it is capable of returning data
for localities throughout the USA by retrieving and formatting decoded METARs
(Meteorological Aerodrome Reports) from NOAA (the USA National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration) and forecasts from NWS (the USA National Weather
Service). The tool is written to function in the same spirit as other
command-line informational utilities like cal(1), calendar(1) and dict(1). It
can retrieve arbitrary weather data via specific command-line switches (station
ID, city, state), or aliases can be configured system wide and on a per-user
basis. It can be freely used and redistributed under the terms of a BSD-like
License.

Why?
----
My girlfriend had a long commute to/from work and school, and often wanted to
check the weather both for home and her office. Unfortunately, starting a Web
browser, pulling up a weather site, entering multiple ZIP codes and waiting for
them to load is time-consuming for the marginally-impatient. Since she tended
to stay logged into a shell server most of the time, I figured I'd install a
quick command-line tool to retrieve weather info for her commute, but to my
surprise, a quick search turned up little that met my basic requirements:

 * retrieve current data on-demand
 * provide both current conditions and short-term forecasts
 * simple, human-readable output
 * easy to configure and use
 * flexible command-line switches and options

Where?
------
A tarball for the most recent version of the weather utility can be had here:

Alternatively, Debian and Ubuntu users can install the weather-util package
from any mirror.
